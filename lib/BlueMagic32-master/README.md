Arduino ESP32 Library for connecting to Blackmagic Cameras using Bluetooth Low Energy.

Control/Read camera parameters like Recording, Focus, Aperture, Shutter Angle, White balance, etc...

#### Tested With BlackMagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K

[This project's roots start way back in January 2019](https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=82040#p473595)

Bluetooth Camera control apps are great! but whether you need a physical/tactile button as a record trigger to use on your rig or you're creating your own custom camera control solution, apps can have their limits. But no more!

ESP32 is a micro-controller from Espressif that can be found in lots of low-cost / pre-made designs and has features like WiFi and Bluetooth!

This library should work with vrtiually any ESP32 device, but for those stepping into the scene for the first time I would highly recommend the [M5StickC](https://m5stack.com/products/stick-c) as this development device comes with a builtin display, buttons, battery and lots more!

# Getting Started

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You will need to install these software packages first. Get the latest version of the Arduino IDE ( version 1.8 or later ) and the ESP32 Arduino library ( version 1.0.4 or later ). Below are download links / guides on how to install them.

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)

- [ESP32 Arduino Library](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/boards_manager.md)

If using an M5StickC you also need to install their library:

- [M5StickC Library](https://github.com/m5stack/M5StickC)

### Installing BlueMagic32

Download this repository as a .zip file and add it to the Arduino Library.

In the Arduino IDE in the toolbar go to:

- _Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library_

## Usage

#### Setup & First Connection

Include the library in your sketch

```
#include <BlueMagic32.h>
```

Create a connection with a device name ( here we use "BlueMagic32" it will show up as the device connected to the camera.) and get the controller object, this should be done in your setup(). We also start Serial here for later use.

```
void setup() {

    Serial.begin(115200);
    BMDConnection.begin("BlueMagic32");
    BMDControl = BMDConnection.connect();

}
```

Upon your first connection, you will need to enter the passcode displayed on your camera. To do this we will open the built in Serial Monitor by going to:

- _Tools > Serial Monitor_

Make sure the baud rate is the same as what we have declared in the setup(), which in this case is: 115200

- _115200 baud_

Now also make sure line ending is set to: Newline

- _Newline_

When the camera displays the passcode, enter that code into the input box at the top and click send. Afterwards the ESP32 and the camera should now be bonded and will remember each other, so when you reboot/ power cycle your ESP32 it will autoconnect to the camera.

#### Write Settings

Upon successful connection, we can now use the controller like this:

we use the **available()** method to make sure we only read/write when a successful connection is established. Any calls to BMDControl should be wrapped in this method to make sure it is safe to call.

```
if (BMDConnection.available()) {

    // Starts recording
    BMDControl->record(true);

    // Sets ISO to 1250
    BMDControl->iso(1250);

    // Sets absolute focus, 0.0 near -> 1.0 far
    BMDControl->focus(0.5);

    // Sets white balance to 5600k
    BMDControl->whiteBalance(5600);

}
```

#### Read Settings

To read camera settings live, we can use the **changed()** method to only update our variables when the camera settings change:

```
if(BMDControl->changed()){

    // Get recording state
    bool recording = BMDControl->isRecording();

    // Get the current shutter setting ( as shutter angle )
    int shutter = BMDControl->getShutter();

    // Get the current frame rate setting
    int frameRate = BMDControl->getFrameRate();

    // Get the current iso setting
    int iso = BMDControl->getIso();

}
```

#### Timecode

To get live timecode:

```
// Get the current timecode as a string
String tc = BMDControl->timecode();

// Get the current timecode as a number
long tc = BMDControl->timecodeRaw();
```

#### Custom Commands

For advanced users, you can use the **custom()** method to send your own data array for camera control:

```
// send the start recording command
uint8_t data[12] = {255, 5, 0, 0, 10, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0};
BMDControl->custom(data, 12);
```

#### Connection Management

When you wish to connect to another camera or need to rebond your ESP32 to the camera you need to:

- Clear the existing bond on your ESP32 by calling this method:
  ```
  BMDConnection.clearPairing();
  ```
- Clear the paired devcies on your camera.

## API Reference
